The txtcomp.c file is a c code that uses huffman encoding to compress text files

Use gcc compiler to compile the file in command line. While executing the executable file through command line the second argument will be your file that you need to compress, the command will look something like this ( ./a.out thefiletobecompressed.txt). The code will give an output.dat file which will contain the huffmann code that can be used to decode the file, it is followed by the binary compressed file.

times up but work still in progress :)
