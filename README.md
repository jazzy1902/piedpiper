*Compressions so efficient that the file given to us is almost reduced to nothing.*
We are a team of 6 first year undergrads working on creating a live website capable of text and image compression along with database management equipped with otp login.
This is a project taken up by us under the Summer of Innovation contest by Coding club, IIT Dharwad.
The compression algorithm we are using is Huffman encoding for text compression.
The frontend is going to be implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
